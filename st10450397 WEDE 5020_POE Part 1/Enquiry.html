      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Slime Season Apparel is a street and trendy inspired clothing brand founded in 2022 by Ayahluma Oyiya.
        It was created as a bold and creative streetwear brand born from the urban culture of Johannesburg, South Africa.
        Inspired by the “slime” slang popularized in hip-hop culture, this brand represents loyalty, authenticity and staying to one’s true circle.
      
        Starting with a small range of printed t-shirts and hoodies, the brand quickly gained attention for its unique color palettes, bold graphics, and confident slogans. 
        Social media and local pop-op events helped grow the following, attracting a loyal community of young trendsetters. 
        Today, Slime Apparel continues to expand its collection, incorporating sustainable materials and limited edition drops, while staying true to its mission: 
        <em>drip with meaning, move with loyalty.</em>
